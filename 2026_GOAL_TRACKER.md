# 🛠️ Project Definitions (For Reference)

### 🟢 Minor Projects (The Training Grounds)

1. **Task Master CLI:** Learn how to store data in files.
2. **Port Scanner:** Learn how to run things in parallel (Concurrency).
3. **Worker Pool:** Learn how to *control* concurrency (don't crash the PC).
4. **Byte Counter:** Learn how to handle streams of data.

### 🔴 Major Project: FlashFetch

* **Description:** A CLI tool that downloads files 500% faster by splitting them into chunks and downloading them in parallel.
* **Key Tech:** Go, Goroutines, Channels, HTTP Range Headers, File I/O.
* **Why:** Solves the "Slow BitTorrent" complaint using developer logic.

### Other Ideas::
Since you are aiming for a **15 LPA+ Backend Role**, your projects need to scream "I understand how systems work under the hood." No simple CRUD apps (e.g., "To-Do List" or "Blog").

Here are 5 **High-Value, "Hard Engineering" Project Ideas** using Go. Each solves a specific problem and targets a specific technical domain.

---

### 1. The "Gamer's Savior"

**Name:** `EldenVault` (Automated Save File Version Control)
**The Problem:** Games like *Elden Ring* or *Ghost of Tsushima* often use a single auto-save slot. If your save gets corrupted, or you make a bad choice (killing an NPC), you are screwed. You can't "roll back."
**The Solution:** A background daemon (service) that watches your game's save folder. Every time the game writes to the file, your tool detects the change, compresses it, and creates a timestamped backup ("Snapshot"). You can "restore" any past state instantly via CLI.
**Why Employers Love It:**

* **System Programming:** You are using OS-level File Watchers (`fsnotify`).
* **Compression:** Implementing Zlib/Gzip to save space.
* **Daemon/Service:** Learning how to write code that runs silently in the background (Windows Service/Linux Daemon).
* **Tech Stack:** Go, SQLite (metadata), Cobra (CLI).

### 2. The "BitTorrent" Alternative (LAN)

**Name:** `GossipDrop` (Zero-Config LAN File Transfer)
**The Problem:** Sending a 5GB file from your PC to your Dad's laptop on the same WiFi is painful. WhatsApp compresses it; Google Drive is slow; Windows Sharing rarely works.
**The Solution:** A tool inspired by Apple's AirDrop but for CLI. You run `./drop send file.mp4` on one machine and `./drop receive` on the other. They find each other automatically (no IP typing) and transfer at full WiFi speed.
**Why Employers Love It:**

* **Networking (UDP/Multicast):** You learn **mDNS** (Service Discovery) to let devices "find" each other without a central server.
* **P2P:** Direct TCP connection between machines.
* **Security:** TLS/Encryption (so neighbors can't steal the file).
* **Tech Stack:** Go, UDP/TCP, Crypto/TLS.

### 3. The "System Design" Classic

**Name:** `GateKeeper` (L7 Load Balancer)
**The Problem:** If you have 3 servers, how do you distribute traffic evenly? If one crashes, how do you stop sending traffic there?
**The Solution:** You build your own NGINX. A reverse proxy that sits in front of 3 dummy web servers. It distributes requests using algorithms like **Round Robin** or **Least Connections** and performs **Active Health Checks** (pinging servers to see if they are alive).
**Why Employers Love It:**

* **The "Holy Grail" of SDE-2 Interviews:** This *is* the System Design interview. Building it proves you understand it.
* **Concurrency:** Handling thousands of incoming requests and proxying them efficiently.
* **Tech Stack:** Go, Docker (to spin up dummy backends).

### 4. The "Infrastructure" Component

**Name:** `VoltaMQ` (Lightweight Message Queue)
**The Problem:** Microservices need to talk to each other asynchronously. Tools like Kafka are massive and hard to run locally.
**The Solution:** A simplified, persistent Message Queue. One service "Publishes" a message to a "Topic", and another service "Subscribes" to it.
**Why Employers Love It:**

* **Data Persistence:** You must write a **Write-Ahead Log (WAL)** to disk so messages aren't lost if the app crashes (Critical Database concept).
* **Protocol Design:** You will design your own simple TCP protocol (or use HTTP).
* **Tech Stack:** Go, TCP, Custom Binary Protocol.

### 5. The "Developer Tool"

**Name:** `LogLoom` (Real-time Distributed Log Aggregator)
**The Problem:** When you deploy an app to 3 different servers, checking logs is a nightmare. You have to SSH into each one and run `tail -f`.
**The Solution:** A central server + small "Agents" that run on other machines. The agents watch log files and stream them via WebSockets to the central server. You view *all* logs in one live dashboard.
**Why Employers Love It:**

* **WebSockets:** Real-time bi-directional communication.
* **Agent Architecture:** Common pattern in DevOps tools (like Datadog/Prometheus).
* **Tech Stack:** Go (Backend/Agents), React (Frontend Dashboard).
